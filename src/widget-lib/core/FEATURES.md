Core Features Implementation Status

## Environment Agnostic

**Requirement:** The library must be environment agnostic (work in browser and in NodeJS; e.g. along with JSDOM)

- **Implementation:** All core files
- **Test Coverage:** `__tests__/setup.js` configures JSDOM for testing environment

## Widget Resolution

**Requirement:** Must have a resolver option that defines how X should load widgets

- **Implementation:** `WidgetLibrary.js` - `setResolver` method
- **Test Coverage:** `__tests__/WidgetLibrary.test.js`:
  - `"should require a resolver to be set"` - checks if initialization fails without resolver
  - `"should throw if resolver doesn't implement loadWidget"` - validates resolver interface

## Initialization and Destruction

**Requirement:** X.init method must be asynchronous while X.destroy synchronous

- **Implementation:** `WidgetLibrary.js` - `init` and `destroy` methods
- **Test Coverage:** `__tests__/WidgetLibrary.test.js`:
  - `"should initialize widgets"` - verifies async initialization
  - `"should destroy widgets"` - verifies synchronous destruction
  - `"should clean up observers on destroy"` - verifies cleanup

## Callback Handling

**Requirement:** User must be able to set a callback in X.init which is called after whole widgets tree is initialized or when initialization failed

- **Implementation:** `WidgetLibrary.js` and `InitializationQueue.js`
- **Test Coverage:**
  - `__tests__/WidgetLibrary.test.js`: `"should handle initialization errors"` - verifies error callback
  - `__tests__/InitializationQueue.test.js`: `"should track initialization stages"` - verifies successful initialization flow

## Instance Management

**Requirement:** The library must guarantee that there is only one instance of a widget per node and that its init and destroy methods called only once

- **Implementation:** `WidgetManager.js`
- **Test Coverage:**
  - `__tests__/WidgetLibrary.test.js`: `"should not initialize same widget multiple times"`
  - `__tests__/WidgetManager.test.js`: `"should manage widget instances"` - verifies single instance per node

## Tree Initialization

**Requirement:** User can call X.init and X.destroy methods with any node in a tree (including multiple times) and in any order

- **Implementation:** `WidgetLibrary.js` and `TreeWalker.js`
- **Test Coverage:**
  - `__tests__/TreeWalker.test.js`: `"finds widget elements"` - verifies tree traversal
  - `__tests__/ComplexTreeInitialization.test.js`:
    - `"should handle deep nested widget structures"` - tests deep tree initialization
    - `"should handle sibling widgets initialization"` - tests sibling initialization
    - `"should handle mixed nested and sibling widgets"` - tests complex structures

## Destruction Behavior

**Requirement:** After execution of the X.destroy method the tree should behave like the X.init method was not called yet

- **Implementation:** `WidgetManager.js` - `destroyTree` method
- **Test Coverage:** `__tests__/WidgetManager.test.js`:
  - `"should remove all instances after tree destruction"`
  - `"should allow re-initialization after destruction"`
  - `"should maintain proper state when destroying subtrees"`
- **Status:** âœ… Covered

## Initialization Process Interruption

**Requirement:** In case of calling destroy method on a subtree while another process had started initialization of the same subtree already and has been waiting for the initialization to finish, that process should receive the WidgetDestroyed error

- **Implementation:** `WidgetManager.js` and `errors.js`
- **Test Coverage:** `__tests__/WidgetManager.test.js`: `"should throw WidgetDestroyedError when destroying initializing widget"`

## Widget Initialization Control

**Requirement:** Decision on whether a widget was initialized or not must be made by the widget

- **Implementation:** `InitializationQueue.js`
- **Test Coverage:** `__tests__/InitializationQueue.test.js`:
  - `"should track initialization stages"`
  - `"should handle stage updates during initialization"`
  - `"should maintain stage during async initialization"`

## DOM Observation

**Requirement:** (Implicit) Library must observe DOM changes for widget initialization

- **Implementation:** `DOMObserver.js`
- **Test Coverage:** `__tests__/DOMObserver.test.js`:
  - `"should call onNodeAdded when element is added"`
  - `"should call onNodeRemoved when element is removed"`
  - `"should observe nested elements"`
